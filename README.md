# PHP Loose Comparison Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP programming related to loose comparison.  Loose comparison (==) does not check type, leading to potential unexpected behavior.  Strict comparison (===) checks both value and type, offering more reliable results.

The `bug.php` file shows the incorrect use of loose comparison, while `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version using strict comparison.

This example highlights the importance of choosing the right comparison operator for your needs, to prevent subtle and hard-to-find bugs.
